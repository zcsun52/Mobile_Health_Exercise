# Mobile_Health_Exercise

[Lecture project provided by Prof. Christian Holz in the course "Mobile Health and Activity Monitoring, Spring 2023, ETH"]

- Develop an algorithm to detect step count based on accelerometer data from a LilyGo smartwatch.
- Data Collection and labelling with LilyGo for the Path Detection in Zurich.
- Developed an algorithm using previously recorded datasets with wearable devices to predict four different aspects of the user's physical activity: activity type, path taken, step count, and smartwatch location on body.
- Sensor Fusion
